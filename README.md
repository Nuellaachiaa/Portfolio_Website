This is a personal portfolio website built mainly with CSS, HTML and Bootstrap
A few more touches will be added soon and then it will be ready for deployment
This porfolio website showcases a bit of my education, my skills, interests and a few projects I've worked on
It also has links to some social platforms where I can be contacted.
